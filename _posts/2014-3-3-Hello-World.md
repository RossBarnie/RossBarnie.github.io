title: Jekyll Now
---

Reddit in all of it's glory directed me to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) so I figured I had better actually do something with this site for once! With that in mind, let's go over what I've been doing while not blogging for the past few months.

Well for one thing I got a job! I'm now a Ruby on Rails developer with [Tictoc](http://www.tictocfamily.com) developing all sorts of websites. My previous experience with git has been invaluable. I don't know how many times I've been working on something and forgotten to switch branch so have had to 
  
  $ git stash
  $ git flow feature start new-feature
  $ git stash pop

But it's probably more than I should have!

I'm really enjoying the job so far and can't wait till I have my own project to work on, which should be in the next couple of weeks. I probably won't be able to talk about specifics of course but if I come across anything technically interesting I'll try and talk about it.

Future posts will probably include my thoughts on OSX and Macs in general since we develop on them, and my new found perspective on Linux as a result, as well as any interesting gems and any useful apps for OSX.

You never know I may start my video game reviews again!
