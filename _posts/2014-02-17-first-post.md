My first post with Jekyll. Hopefully this will be the first of many 
more to come!

I've started to work with geany recently so I will be further 
exploring its capabilities. In one of my github projects, 
[rmt](http://github.com/RossBarnie/rmt), I used PyCharm which, over 
time, grew increasingly grating which I will ellaborate on in future 
posts. Geany was recommended by a good [friend](http://ck26.net) and I 
trust his opinion in most cases!

Anyway, further details about what I want to do with this site will 
follow, for now I have to get back to Universtiy work since I've spent 
about an hour doing this instead!
