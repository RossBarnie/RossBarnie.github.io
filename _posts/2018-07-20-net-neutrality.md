title: Still writing blogs, honest!
---

I've not been writing much for this blog recently, however I have been writing for [tictoc](http://tictocdigital.co.uk) a fair bit.
Most recently on the subject of [Net Neutrality](https://www.tictocdigital.co.uk/latest/65-what-is-net-neutrality).
While I tried to keep a balanced tone, it should be clear where my thoughts lie on government-funded companies trying to make access to the internet (something that is quickly becoming a human right) more difficult and expensive.
Selfishly this is because I don't want to pay more.
Morally I feel it's wrong that tax-funds should go to billion-pound profit margin-earning corporations to fund projects which will ultimately lead to more profits for those companies with the costs passed to the taxpayer through those tax-funds and through increased service costs.
This is without even mentioning my first drafts of the blog which included more explicit references to, and condemnation of, a certain family that controls the majority of media in the western world.

Developers at tictoc are regularly consulted on blog posts published on our site, such as the [Developer's Checklist for Launching Websites](https://www.tictocdigital.co.uk/latest/57-a-developers-checklist-for-launching-websites), a look at the checks we perform (and why) before a site is launched, and of course, the bane of any data holder's lives at the moment, [GDPR](https://www.tictocdigital.co.uk/latest/53-gdpr-what-you-need-to-know).

Way back in May 2017 I also wrote a post on [how to write a good bug report](https://www.tictocdigital.co.uk/latest/40-how-to-write-a-bug-report-that-saves-you-time-and-money), which I'd be the first to admit was in response to some particularly lacking bug reports we'd received at the time, but was written with the genuine intention of fixing your problems faster and not any animosity towards any particular person or company.
While writing it I remembered with some fondness the high school computing studies courses that drilled "INPUT, PROCESS, OUTPUT" into me as a teenager.

So I'm still writing blogs, still working at tictoc and still working on problems. I recently contributed to the official [icinga2 ansible role](https://github.com/Icinga/ansible-icinga2) which I'm excited to talk about as well, so keep checking back or subscribe to the [RSS](/feed.xml) feed.

Also shoutout to my fellow tictoc developer, Richard, who is [starting his own blog](http://demandingepicurean.co.uk) about his many, many (many, many...) thoughts on food and beer. He managed to convince me to stop drinking "peasant juice" (read: cheap lager), so it's probably worth occasionally listening to what he has to say.
