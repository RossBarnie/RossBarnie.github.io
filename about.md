I am a Ruby on Rails developer with [tictoc](http://tictocfamily.com) having
graduated from University of Glasgow in 2014 with a BSc(Hons) in Computer
Science.  At university I learned python, Java, some Haskell, SQL.  Since then
I've worked at tictoc as a Ruby on Rails developer primarily on Rails web
applications and managing servers via Ansible. With this experience I had the
great privilege to present a [talk at AnsibleFest
London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DFo2zienXc) which was a fantastic
experience. While I occasionally (ok, rarely) write here I also write for
tictoc digital's blog, for example the post that inspired my talk at
[AnsibleFest](https://www.tictocdigital.co.uk/latest/29-ansible-the-answer-to-managing-multiple-servers),
and on how to write [good bug
reports](https://www.tictocdigital.co.uk/latest/40-how-to-write-a-bug-report-that-saves-you-time-and-money).

## My Setup

At home I use a Macbook Pro Retina 13", I also have a Windows desktop computer
that I primarily use for gaming.  My shell of choice is ZSH (if you aren't using
ZSH for a good reason, please let me know!) with
[antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) to manage plugins, having used
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/) for about a year.  At
both work and home I use NeoVim with various plugins.  You can find more of my
setup via my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/RossBarnie/dotfiles).
